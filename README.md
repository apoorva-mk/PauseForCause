# PauseForCause
An Android application to help people contribute to NGOs (developed during Athena '18-Women's only Hackathon in NITK)
</br>**How it works:**
- A user can find a relevant task that is offered by any organisation which needs some small task to be fulfilled
- Upon completion of the task, the stipend will be paid to an NGO of the user's choice
- A third party will resolve any decrepancies that arise with respect to task completion of payment fulfillment
